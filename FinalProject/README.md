This tool is used to make a character model do a backflip! Use this tool to get a quick and easy preview of your model in action. The tool contains a "backflipAction" function and a "stopBackflip" function. The model will continue to flip untill you use the stopBackflip function.

To use, select the model to do a backflip. Run the "backflipAction" function. Provide the backflipAction Function with a height peramiter to determin how high they will jump. Then run the "stopBackflip" function to end.

This tool works best if your model has a scale of (1,1,1) and the pivot is centered on the character. Adjust your height peramiter on the backflipAction function for appropriate flipping height.
